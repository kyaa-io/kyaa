# ByUs mint worker

One-shot, lease-based Passport/Stamp mint worker. It is disabled unless
`WORKER_ENABLED=true` is supplied explicitly. The package does not schedule
itself; Supabase remains the single cron/queue source of truth.

The default `WORKER_CAPABILITY_VERSION=v1` claims only the existing Passport,
Stamp, Reaction, and configured Collectible jobs. Set it to
`community-stamp-v1` only after the matching database migration is active; that
explicit capability adds `community_stamp` jobs while preserving the existing
claim set.

## Recovery invariant

The worker signs locally, then persists both the expected transaction hash and
the signed raw transaction while it still owns the database lease. Only then
does it broadcast. A retry re-broadcasts the identical bytes, so it cannot
consume a second nonce or create a second credential. Before any preparation it
also reconciles the contract's unique key mapping and mint event.

## Commands

```sh
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

Copy `.env.example` to an ignored environment-specific file. Never place the
service role, Pinata JWT, or relayer private key in a web or `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
environment.

`METADATA_ASSET_BASE_URI` must be a versioned `ipfs://` CID. Mutable HTTPS
artwork is rejected. Run one active replica per relayer account until nonce
reservation is coordinated at the database layer.

## AWS Lambda deployment

`npm run build:lambda` creates the Node.js 24 Lambda bundle. Package it as
`apps/worker/lambda-package.zip`, then deploy each environment explicitly:

```sh
./scripts/deploy-aws-worker.sh dev false
./scripts/deploy-aws-worker.sh prod false
```

Both functions are created disabled and with reserved concurrency `1`. The
Lambda execution role can read only `byus/worker/<environment>` in Secrets
Manager. Enabling a function requires a complete, strictly validated secret
including an immutable metadata asset CID; never enable it with placeholder
metadata or a shared Dev/Production secret.

The notification delivery worker is packaged and deployed independently, so
mint worker configuration and scheduling remain unchanged. Validate the bundle,
IAM document and exact target names without contacting AWS:

```sh
./scripts/deploy-aws-notification-worker.sh dev false --dry-run
AWS_PROFILE=<explicit-profile> EXPECTED_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=<verified-prod-account> \
  BYUS_NOTIFICATION_PROD_DEPLOY_CONFIRM=I_UNDERSTAND_BYUS_NOTIFICATION_PROD_MUTATION \
  ./scripts/deploy-aws-notification-worker.sh prod false --dry-run
```

Omit `--dry-run` only during an authorized release. The script creates a
fail-closed Lambda and an EventBridge `rate(1 minute)` rule. A disabled deploy
leaves both the Lambda flag and rule disabled. Enabling requires the exact
`byus/notification/<environment>` secret to exist first. Its execution role can
read only that environment's notification secret; it cannot read mint-worker or
opposite-environment secrets.
Production has no default profile. It requires an explicit `AWS_PROFILE`, an
explicit 12-digit `EXPECTED_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`, the exact
`BYUS_NOTIFICATION_PROD_DEPLOY_CONFIRM` acknowledgement shown above, and an
exact STS caller-account match before any AWS mutation. Dev and Prod may share
an AWS account; function, role, rule, permission and secret names remain
strictly environment-suffixed.

`TELEGRAM_CERTIFICATION_REVIEW_MODE=enabled` enables private certification-proof
delivery and approval callbacks in the configured Telegram group. It is disabled
by default and is accepted only with the Production Supabase project, production
notification environment, a valid bot token, and a negative group/supergroup chat
ID. Both `TELEGRAM_ALERT_MODE=enabled` and `TELEGRAM_COMMAND_MODE=enabled` are
required so the alert chat and existing command cursor are active. The existing
command consumer remains the sole `getUpdates` cursor; do not run
a separate Telegram poller. Proofs are downloaded from the private
`certification-proofs` bucket and are never written to logs.
EventBridge and the Notification Lambda are the canonical scheduler. Every
invocation first runs `enqueue_due_notification_maintenance(now)` (scheduled
notifications, delivery backfill, and Collectible window/availability/expiry
maintenance), then claims and sends. Enqueue failure is fail-closed: no delivery is
claimed or pushed. The protected Web enqueue route is manual diagnostics only;
runtime operation does not require a Vercel cron or `CRON_SECRET`.

### YouTube live start alerts

When the existing production Telegram alert mode is enabled, each notification
tick first refreshes `https://kyaa.io/api/public/live-now?v=2` with a 15-second
timeout, then processes the existing Telegram queue. This also discovers streams
without website visitors. The website retains the YouTube API key and existing
shared discovery cache/quota policy; the refresh sends no worker credentials.
Discovery failures are logged and do not stop already queued Telegram alerts.

Only fresh, confirmed YouTube live cards for published creators with an active
YouTube link are captured. The web route and background refresh share the same
capture RPC. One permanent `telegram_youtube_live_starts` row per video ID keeps
deduplication across concurrent observers, process restarts, temporary offline or
unavailable observations, alert reactivation, and the outbox's 30-day retention.
A different video ID creates a new alert. Private member data and external
broadcast titles are not copied into these alerts. Hidden creators are suppressed
at claim time.

Deploy the compatible notification worker first, apply
`20261020120000_telegram_youtube_live_starts.sql`, then deploy the web capture.
The existing configured Telegram destination, FIFO batch limits, room throttle,
send lease and unknown-outcome policy apply. Telegram has no idempotent send API:
an uncertain send is never automatically retried, so delivery cannot be promised
when a provider response is lost. Discovery cadence, cache age, provider quota
and existing queue backlog affect delay; a short stream can be missed between
successful observations. No other live providers are added by this change.

Local verification (no real sends):
`bash scripts/verify-telegram-youtube-live-starts.sh`, worker Telegram tests, and
web `server/youtube/live-start-alerts.test.ts` / existing live discovery tests.

## Kakao Alimtalk via SOLAPI

`KAKAO_ALIMTALK_MODE=solapi` enables a dedicated Kakao queue and requires both
`SOLAPI_API_KEY` and `SOLAPI_API_SECRET`. It is independent from
`NOTIFICATION_EXTERNAL_MODE`; leaving Email external delivery disabled does not
prevent the Kakao queue from running. Each one-minute tick maintains expired
states, reconciles at most two provider message IDs through the canonical SOLAPI
list API, then claims at most two new sends. Only a successful database `begin`
CAS can authorize the POST. Provider acceptance remains pending until a fully
correlated `COMPLETE` result with status code `4000` is observed. Unknown or
uncorrelated results never retry or fall back to Email.

## SES notification email

`NOTIFICATION_EXTERNAL_MODE=ses_email` uses the email-only, consent-aware
`claim_email_notification_deliveries` RPC. Region and sender are fixed to
`ap-northeast-2` and `notifications@byus.kr`; batch size must be at most 2.
Deploying code does not enable external delivery: preserve `disabled` until the
real-recipient automatic delivery is explicitly activated.

The B poster template renders real text, one action link and a plain-text fallback.
It supports Korean/English labels, KST dates, the selected B star/rule motif,
separate large date/time rows and a 234px poster-frame/card overlap.
The poster tail preserves the artist image without cropping. Outlook uses a
non-overlapping fallback; the overlap was verified in an actual Naver web inbox. The SES sender embeds the original
ByUs wordmark and published poster as INLINE CID attachments. This avoids the
`Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin` restriction on the website's images.
Logo bytes in `src/email-logo.ts` must match the source wordmark under the web
public assets; update both if branding changes.

Posters are fetched only from the trusted site's `/images/` or the configured
Supabase project's public `cms-assets` bucket. Redirects, URL credentials and query
strings are rejected; requests have a 3-second timeout and 3 MiB streaming limit.
JPEG, PNG and the CMS preview pipeline's WebP format have signature validation.
A failed or unsupported poster uses the text artwork fallback. WebP rendering
still depends on the receiving mail client. Pretendard is an optional webfont;
system fonts remain necessary for clients that strip or do not load webfonts.

### Trigger coverage and language

Email supports `live_reserved`, `live_10m`, `live_changed`, `survey_reminder`,
`benefit_available`, `benefit_unlocked`, `benefit_won`,
`recipient_information_required`, `fulfillment_meaningful_update`,
`collectible_claim_available`, `collectible_claim_expiring`, and `level_up`.
The five fulfillment states have separate copy, yielding 16 scenarios / 32 KO-EN
variants. `live_24h` and `live_cancelled` are excluded from direct, fallback, and
already queued email; inbox, push, and Kakao retain those kinds.

Apply `20260906150000_fan_email_trigger_lifecycle.sql` before the worker or web
locale changes. First sign-in initializes a null `app_users.preferred_locale`
from the app locale; Settings PATCH persists explicit subsequent choices.
Existing unset users default to Korean. The delivery plan snapshots email locale,
including Kakao-to-email fallback; Kakao keeps its existing Korean payload.
The email renderer derives subject/body/CTA from kind and locale, not stored
Korean notification copy. CMS titles use the requested locale, with existing
content-localization fallback when that translation is absent.

Claims and `revalidate_email_notification_delivery` check current consent,
schedule, supersession, publication, survey/claim completion, and action state.
Missing required fulfillment/level context or unsupported template keys fail
permanently. Known excluded or no-longer-eligible jobs are terminally suppressed.
A future scheduled job remains queued. Sent records are not rewritten.

Regression verification:

```sh
BYUS_CLEAN_DB_ASSERTION_FILE="$PWD/scripts/verify-fan-email-trigger-lifecycle.sql" \
  bash scripts/verify-clean-migration-chain.sh
npm run test --workspace @byus/worker -- --no-file-parallelism
```

The lifecycle fixture exercises real reservation, scheduler, revision, winner,
fulfillment, tier, and Collectible producers, including stale/completed/consent
cases. Actual SES receipt evidence remains separate from test-sink records.
SES has no idempotency token: a lost provider response or a completion-write
failure can still cause duplicate delivery on retry; leases and source keys do
not provide an exactly-once guarantee.

### AWS staging and self-hosted REST

Worker deployments accept `dev`, `staging`, and `prod`. Staging requires an explicit
`AWS_PROFILE` and 12-digit `EXPECTED_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`; it uses only
`byus/worker/staging` and `byus/notification/staging`. The committed staging IAM
policies contain account placeholders rendered against the verified account.
Existing production acknowledgement gates remain required. Worker enablement and
Benefit maintenance default to disabled; enable each separately after validating
the target environment. Keep the existing cron disabled before enabling any new
AWS scheduler for the same worker.

Set both `POSTGREST_URL` (the REST root, without an added `/rest/v1`) and
`POSTGREST_SERVICE_TOKEN` to route all worker database queries and RPCs to an AWS
PostgREST endpoint. Partial configuration is rejected. With neither set, the
existing Supabase database connection is used. `SUPABASE_URL` and
`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are required only for legacy Supabase mode. With AWS
REST and `AWS_STORAGE_ENABLED=true`, notification workers use their real private
S3 adapter and need neither legacy credential; mint/maintenance REST clients do
not create a Supabase auth or storage client. Legacy Storage retains its endpoint
and credential when selected. Lambda reads these fields
from its environment-specific secret, not the invoking event. Never expose the
PostgREST service token to a browser.

For Telegram certification review after the S3 cutover, set
`AWS_STORAGE_ENABLED=true`, `AWS_REGION`, and `S3_PRIVATE_BUCKET` in the notification
worker secret. Defaults continue to use Supabase Storage. The worker reads only
`certification-proofs/<path>` from the private bucket, checks deletion tombstones,
and bounds proof downloads to 3 MiB. Set `AWS_STORAGE_ENABLED=true` and
`S3_PRIVATE_BUCKET` for the notification deployment script as well; it grants only
`s3:GetObject` on that bucket's `certification-proofs/*` namespace. The platform's
AES256 bucket encryption needs no KMS grant.

All worker deployments now target Sallylab `996702758024` in Seoul, with explicit
`AWS_PROFILE` and account verification for every environment. Old coredot-dev
account defaults are not used. Production deployment acknowledgements remain.
For AWS notification data, bind `NOTIFICATION_EXTERNAL_ENVIRONMENT` and
`BYUS_DATA_ENVIRONMENT` (`production` only for prod, otherwise `development`) to
its exact private REST base: `https://data.dev.kyaa.io`,
`https://data.staging.kyaa.io`, or `https://data.kyaa.io`. Credentials, query/hash,
extra paths or nondefault ports are rejected; Telegram's production-only send
guard remains in addition to this binding. Email poster downloads accept only
canonical kyaa origins' `/public-assets/cms-assets/` namespace, with existing
MIME, size, magic-byte and no-redirect checks.
